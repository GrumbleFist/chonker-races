4. Add NetworkManager GameObject with NetworkManager script

## Scripts Integration

### 1. Car Controller Setup

1. Attach CarController to your car GameObject
2. Assign wheel colliders and transforms
3. Set motor force, brake force, and steering values
4. Configure damage and power-up settings

### 2. Input Actions

1. Create Input Actions asset: Right-click in Project > Create > Input Actions
2. Name it "CarInputActions"
3. Set up actions for Move, Brake, and Boost
4. Assign to CarInputActions script

### 3. Network Setup

1. Add NetworkManager to scene
2. Create player prefab with NetworkedCar script
3. Set up spawn points
4. Configure network settings

## Building the Game

### 1. PC Build

1. File > Build Settings
2. Add scenes to build
3. Select "PC, Mac & Linux Standalone"
4. Choose target platform (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
5. Click "Build"

### 2. Android Build

1. Install Android Build Support in Unity Hub
2. File > Build Settings
3. Switch platform to Android
4. Player Settings:
   - Set Package Name
   - Set Minimum API Level
   - Configure icons and splash screen
5. Click "Build"

## Testing

### 1. Single Player Testing

1. Play the scene in Unity
2. Test car controls (WASD or Arrow Keys)
3. Test power-ups and damage zones
4. Test race progression

### 2. Multiplayer Testing

1. Build the game
2. Run one instance as host
3. Run another instance as client
4. Test network synchronization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Input not working**: Check Input System settings
2. **Network not connecting**: Verify NetworkManager setup
3. **Car physics issues**: Check Rigidbody and WheelCollider settings
4. **UI not displaying**: Verify Canvas settings and script references

### Performance Optimization

1. Use LOD groups for distant objects
2. Optimize textures and models
3. Use object pooling for power-ups
4. Implement culling for off-screen objects

## Next Steps

1. Create more detailed track designs
2. Add more power-up types
3. Implement different car models
4. Add sound effects and music
5. Create more race modes
6. Add leaderboards and achievements
